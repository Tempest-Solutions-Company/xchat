## Linking Discord and Telegram

### Important Note About Permissions
All configuration slash commands in this bot require Discord Administrator permissions. This is by design to prevent unauthorized users from changing your bot's configuration. Only server administrators can run the setup and configuration commands.

### Step 1: Set Up Discord Channel
1. Run the bot using `python main.py`
2. In Discord, go to the channel you want to use for cross-platform chat
3. Use the command `/set_chat_channel #your-channel-name` (requires administrator permissions)
4. The bot will confirm the channel has been set up

### Step 2: Add Bot to Telegram Group
1. In Discord, use the command `/telegram_invite_link` (requires administrator permissions)
2. Add the bot to your Telegram group using the provided link
3. Make the bot an admin in the Telegram group (this is important!)
4. Send a message in the Telegram group

### Step 3: Get Telegram Chat ID
1. In your Telegram group, send the command `/chatid` or `/id`
2. The bot will reply with the chat ID (usually looks like `-123456789`)
3. Copy this chat ID
4. Alternatively, use `/get_telegram_updates` in Discord to see recent messages and chat IDs

### Step 4: Link Discord and Telegram
1. In Discord, use the command `/link_telegram -123456789` (replace with your actual chat ID)
2. The bot will confirm the successful linking
3. Test the connection by sending a message in Discord and checking if it appears in Telegram
4. Send a message in Telegram and check if it appears in Discord

### Common Issues
1. **Messages not being relayed**:

   - Verify that you're using the correct channel in Discord
   - Check that the chat ID format is correct (group IDs usually start with a minus sign)

2. **Privacy Mode Issues**:
   - By default, Telegram bots have privacy mode enabled
   - Either make the bot an admin in the group OR
   - Disable privacy mode via BotFather

   - Verify you have admin permissions in Discord
   - Check that the bot has necessary permissions

4. **Getting the right Chat ID**:
   - Group chat IDs typically start with a minus sign (e.g., `-1001234567890`)
   - Make sure to include the minus sign when linking the chat
